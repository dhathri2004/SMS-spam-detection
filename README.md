pam detection is a branch of information security that focuses on identifying and filtering out unwanted or unsolicited messages, commonly known as spam, from legitimate communications. The term "spam" typically refers to unwanted emails, but it can also include unsolicited messages in other forms, such as text messages, instant messages, or comments on websites.
